1.Introduction:

Conducted a User Research Case Study focusing on the observational study of iPhone users and validate whether the incentive to utilize iMessage feature influences people's decisions to buy iPhones.

2.Context:

iPhones, particularly popular among students and teenagers are widely used for communication and interaction. The exclusive iMessage feature, along with the variety of apps available in the App Store, contributes to the iPhone's popularity.

Our study intends to delve deep into the intriguing trend of high iPhone usage among students, particularly the role iMessage plays in this loyalty. We are curious about the factors that drive this preference, the value students extract from it, and its influence on their smartphone usage patterns. One crucial question we aim to answer is whether iMessage is a deciding factor that nudges students to opt for an iPhone over other smartphones.

3.Target Audience:

The findings of this research can provide valuable insights for Apple Inc. to understand what attracts younger demographics to their products, aiding improvements in areas like manufacturing innovation, promotional campaigns, consumer connections, and user acquisition. Other smartphone developers can also learn from these insights to enhance their own products and services, while researchers can gain a deeper understanding of technology usage trends among young people. Furthermore, UX designers can utilize these revelations to better comprehend the preferences and demands of young smartphone users, resulting in more logical, appealing, and user-friendly designs. Marketing and advertising agencies can also leverage the study's findings to create impactful strategies targeting young smartphone users.
